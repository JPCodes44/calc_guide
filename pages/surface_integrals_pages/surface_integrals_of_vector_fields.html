        <h3 class="text-start fs-5">Chapter 6.3 : Surface Integrals of Vector Fields</h3>
        <hr class="hr-blurry" style="background-color: rgb(0, 22, 37); width: 100%;">
        <h3 class="text-start mb-4 fs-6">Just like we did with line integrals, we also need to explore surface integrals of vector fields. When dealing with line integrals, the orientation of the curve we were integrating along could affect the answer. This same idea also applies to surface integrals. So, before diving into surface integrals of vector fields, we must introduce the concept of an oriented surface.
        <br><br>If you remember, we discovered a Mobius Strip in elementary school, a surface with only ONE side (A tangent plane on every point except the boundary). As you might have noticed, there would also have to be two normal vectors, as each point on the Mobius strip can either face up or down. Depending on the orientation of the strip, we will determine the set of the unit normal vectors that we would like to choose.
        <br><br>For certain types of oriented surfaces, there is a convention we must follow. To begin, we must define what we mean by a closed surface, simply a surface that forms the boundary of a solid region \(E\). A great example of a closed surface is the surface of a sphere. Now, when we talk about the orientation of a closed surface \(S\), we say it has a positive orientation when we choose a set of unit normal vectors that point outward from the region \(E\). Conversely when the normal vectors point inwards towards the region \(E\), we consider the orientation of the closed surface to be negative.
        <br><br>Note that the convention for \(E\) and \(S\) only applies to closed surfaces.
        <br><br>To determine the surface integrals of vector fields, we must write a formula for the unit normal vector corresponding with the orientation we are working with. 
        <br><br>Let's suppose we have a function \(z=g \left(x,y \right)\). Then, we will define a new function in terms of our new function, which is the surface given by \(f \left(x,y,z \right)=0\). Recall that the gradient of f is orthogonal/normal to the surface f(x,y,z)=0. We will turn the gradient of \(f\) into a unit vector to fit the definition of a surface integral:
        <br><br>When dealing with a surface, paying attention to the normal vector's z-component (indicated by the k-hat vector) is important, as it's always positive and generally points upwards. This may not be straight up, but it'll have an upward component. This becomes significant when working with a closed surface and needing to determine the positive orientation. We can decide if the "positive" orientation should point up or down by looking at the normal vector. Remember that "positive" means pointing out the region, which may sometimes require a downward orientation. But if we need the downward orientation, we can take the negative of the unit vector instead. And remember, we always have the option of choosing the unit normal vector that best fits our needs.
        <br><br>Let's discuss how to figure out the unit normal vector if the surface is described parametrically. 
        <br><br>Let's suppose we have a parametric surface: 
        <br><br>First, recall that \(r_u \times r_v\) is normal to the tangent plane at a specific point. Therefore that means \(r_u \times r_v\) is a normal vector to the surface at that point. To ensure that it is a unit normal vector, we will use the unit normal equation as follows:
        <br><br>Like before, it's important to check whether the computed vector faces the correct direction. If not, we can flip the vector to make it a point correctly.
        Also, keep in mind that any surface that can be expressed as \(z = g \left(x,y \right)\), \(y = g \left(x,z \right)\), or \(x = g \left(y,z \right)\) can be parameterized quite easily. So, we can use the parameterization formula to determine the unit normal vector.
        Now that we've covered oriented surfaces and their associated unit normal vectors, we're ready to give a formula for computing surface integrals of vector fields. Specifically, the surface integral of vector field \(F\) over surface \(S\), given a unit normal vector \(n\), is defined as...
        <br><br>The right integral is a standard surface integral, sometimes called the flux of \(F\) across \(S\). 
        <br><br>To work an example, suppose we have a surface given by \(z=g \left(x,y \right)\) given the vector field:
        <br><br>And also that the orientation is an upwards orientation. Therefore we can define the surface integral of F over S as,
        <br><br>Let's remember that the formula we just discussed assumes the upward orientation of the surface. If we needed to use the downward orientation instead, we would have to change the signs on both the normal vector and the integrand. Therefore, it's essential to be careful when using this formula and, if necessary, derive it again for each specific case.
        <br><br>When dealing with surfaces not given in the parametric form, there are six possible integrals to consider (two for each form of the surface equations). For each form, there will be two possible unit normal vectors to choose from, and it's crucial to select the correct one that matches the orientation of the surface. Nonetheless, the derivation of each formula is similar to the one we just went through, so it should be easy to do as needed.
        <br><br>Also, note that the messy square root in the denominator of the unit normal vector will always cancel out, so we won't need to include it when deriving the formula. We will see more examples of this as we move forward. Finally, the square root is essentially just the magnitude of the gradient vector, as seen here:
        <br><br>Let's look at the formula for the surface integral when the surface is given parametrically by \vec{r} \left(u,v \right). In this case, the surface integral is:
        <br><br>Again, note that we may have to change the sign on \(r_u \times r_v\) to match the orientation of the surface, so there are two formulas here. Also, note that the magnitude cancels in this case, so we won't need to worry about it in these problems.
        <br><br>Let's work on a few examples:
        <br><br>We will leave this section with a quick interpretation of a surface integral over a vector field. If v is the velocity field of a fluid, then the surface integral \(\iint_S = F \cdot dS\)
        is the fluid flow rate across the surface \(S\). This is sometimes called the flux of the vector field across the surface.
        It is often helpful in fluid dynamics to determine the fluid flow rate across a given surface, so surface integrals can be used to help with these types of calculations.
        <br><br>Note that the surface integral represents the volume of fluid flowing through \(S\) per time unit (e.g. seconds or minutes or whatever unit you want to use).
