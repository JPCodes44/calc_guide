Hey all! Welcome to my Calculus 3 guide! I am excited to announce that in my project,
I explain numerous concepts relating to vector calculus, Lagrange multipliers 
and many other exciting features within the world of math!

I am also open to supplying help for my fellow classmates who are stuck in courses 
like NE 241, NE 217 or any other subjects related to vector calculus.

As for libraries, this website contains MathJAX for math notation, VanillaJS 
for javascript features, and Bootstrap 5 for forms/layouts of images/text.
